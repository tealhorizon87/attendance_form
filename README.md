## UX

### User Stories
  - As a user, I want to:
    - have a clear picture of what the page is for
    - easily understand what information is required by the form
    - be notified if I have not filled the form in correctly
    - be notified that the form was submitted successfully
  - As the site administrator, I want to:
    - be emailed with all the relevant details contained in the submitted form

### Design
This page is a simple form, made using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/), and then submitted via [emailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/). Once the form is submitted, the user is directed to a 'thank you' page so that they are notified that the form is submitted.

### Wireframes
Below is the wireframe used to help design the page layout

### Languages:
  - [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
    - This is the main mark-up language for the project

## Testing
As this is a relatively simple page, the testing carried out is also relatively basic.


## Deployment
### Forking the Repository
If you would like to view/change the code for the project then you can copy this repository to your GitHub account by forking it. You will then be able to do this without affecting the original repository:
1. From the repository home page,  click the 'fork' button (just below your picture with the dropdown menu)
2. You should now have a copy of the repository on your account

### Making a Local Clone
1. From the repository home page, select the 'code' tab (next to the green 'Gitpod' button)
2. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
3. Open Git Bash
4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
5. Type 'git clone', and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.
6. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
7. Alternatively, you can use 'Open with GitHub Desktop' and follow the instructions, or just download the ZIP file containing the code files
